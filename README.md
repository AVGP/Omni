# Omni
## An experiment in multi-modal web apps

##What's this?
Omni is a testbed for web-component based, web applications that can be running inside Omni.
Think of it as a browser-based "desktop" in which multiple windows and "applications" can be run.

It should furthermore explore how such a system could be multi-modal, presenting a different UI for small screen devices, large screen devices, touch vs. keyboard / mouse input, etc.

## "Nothing to see here, move along"
Right now there's nothing interesting happening here.
It may get infrequent updates, becoming actually interesting. I'll keep you posted here.
